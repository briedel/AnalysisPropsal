\section{Muon Background}

Over the course of the last several years the frequency and $\xi$ of false supernova alerts has risen, see Figure~\ref{fig:SNDAQtriggershisto}. In \cite{vbaumaster} it has been shown that atmospheric muons are main cause of false triggers and are correlated to the muon hit rate, see Figure~\ref{fig:muratetriggersig}. The nature of these muons however was not explored. The rising significance of the alerts was initially attributed to increasing solar activity as the sun approached the maximum of the 11-year solar cycle, see Figure~\ref{fig:solarcycle}, as the temperature of the upper atmosphere rises with increasing solar irradiation. The rise in the significances should not be significantly effected by long-term effects such as the change in the flux or energy spectrum of the atmospheric muons, as the background region is defined over significantly shorter timespan than these effects.
